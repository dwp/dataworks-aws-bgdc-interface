The cluster can be started and stopped on-demand using CI jobs. The mechanism for this involving an EMR Launcher Lambda is similar to the one used in [Analytical Dataset Generation].

## Password rotation

BGDC Interface uses a read-only MySQL user to access Hive Metastore Aurora database. The password for this user can be rotated using provided CI jobs.
